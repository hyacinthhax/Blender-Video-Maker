# Blender-Video-Maker
This is a video maker I'm making for blender!

# Instructions

I made the addon which replaced the standalone version. To install, go to blenders preferences, click the dropdown on the top right and click install from disk; Then click on the addon file. It should install then just enable it and select the side menu on blender by the directional ball. Select the song and the grid layout and it should generate the icosphere's that morph and move.
